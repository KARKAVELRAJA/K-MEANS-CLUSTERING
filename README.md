# K-MEANS-CLUSTERING

### IMPLEMENTION OF K-MEANS CLUSTERING USING SCIKIT-LEARN PYTHON LIBRARY TO PREDICT INCOME SPENT

- K-Means Clustering is an Unsupervised Learning algorithm, which groups the unlabeled dataset into different clusters
- In this project, at first the dataset is loaded and pre-processing steps are carried out
- Then, by using K-MEANS CLUSTERING MODEL from scikit-learn python library, the pre-processed data are trained and the output is predicted
- Finally, the predicted output is visualized
